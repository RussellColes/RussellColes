# Russell Coles

I'm a positive and proactive team player, actively looking to join a dynamic team where my desire to grow and develop will be fostered. The Makers bootcamp and my independent learning have given me a solid foundation in software engineering and inspired me to learn more about data engineering and cloud technologies. I am excited to know more and continue to improve both my technical competencies and the quality of my code by learning from more experienced colleagues and through the Data Engineering Apprenticeship course. My successful career in education has trained me to be an excellent communicator to a wide range of audiences; my understanding of the process of learning and my resilience when solving problems or approaching new challenges, have made retraining an exciting and fulfilling journey which I am keen to continue in my new role.

## Skills

- **Positive** - I am very much a "glass half full" type of person and I use this positivity to bring people with me in projects. This skill has been developed working with teenagers who often initially didn't want to learn what I needed to teach them. Through working with them and supporting them, I was able to bring them with me to achieve the desired end result.
- **Passion for learning** - Learning new things has always inspired me. Assimilating a vast amount of knowledge each week on the Makers Bootcamp has reinvigorated my desire to learn more. In my teaching career, I have learned new subjects and kept abreast of teaching methodologies and techniques while going above this and developing my skills as a middle leader through the Middle Leadership Development Program. Supported by monthly seminars, I implement a new student support system, increasing achievement for the targeted students. As Lead Personal Coach I trained as a Personal Performance Coach with The Coaching Academy. Learning new skills helps me develop my job and recognise improvements I could make.
- **Empathetic** -  I am an empathetic person and fit well into a team aided by my training as a personal performance coach. The many teams I have worked in over the years have required different approaches to ensure a good working relationship with every team member. I am energised by working with other people and actively enjoy team work and pair programming. 
- **Explanations** - Training as a teacher has provided me with the tools to explain technical concepts in a straightforward, intelligible manner to non-technical people, which will help when needing to communicate with other teams across the business. I am also keen, further down the line, to use these skills to help develop more junior colleagues.
- **Agile Methodologies** - Learning the basics of Agile methodologies at Makers has shown me that my natural manner for leading and contributing to projects is Agile in nature. My line management style supports my team members to implement their own projects iteratively over time and celebrates smaller steps made each week.
- **Leadership** - Experience of planning and implementing projects means I am able to look at a task, not solely from my own perspective, but also take into account the wider business implications and bring multiple stakeholders on board with the project.
