I'm a positive and proactive team player, keen to join a dynamic team where my desire to grow and develop will be fostered. The Makers bootcamp and my independent learning have given me a solid foundation in software development and fostered in me the desire to know more, continue learning new skills and improving my technical competencies. My successful career in education has trained me to be an excellent communicator to a wide range of audiences; my understanding of the process of learning, along with my resilience when solving problems and approaching new challenges, have made retraining an exciting and fulfilling journey which I am keen to continue in my new role.

## Work Experience

**Tudor Park Education Trust** (_November 2015 to August 2024_)  
_Assistant Principal (Final Position)_

- **Communication** - Working within and leading teams to effect change (Assistant Principal, Lead of Coaching Department, Head of Sixth Form); regularly communicating with stakeholders, ranging from students, to parents, to outside agencies in person, on calls and in written communication.  I am comfortable speaking in front of small and large groups and confident to put my point of view across.
- **Leadership and Responsibility** - Leading the Sixth Form of 200 students; co-lead of student Personal Development in the school, focusing on academic and personal coaching, and safeguarding.
- **Planning and Project Management** - Contributing to school strategic development and operational logistics allowed me to develop my long term planning skills for large scale projects such as developing the subjects on the curriculum, staffing and raising student achievement. In addition, it required me to plan, organise and conduct themed weeks, trips abroad, and ad hoc changes to the standard daily life of the school as required.
- **Collaboration and Culture of Mutual Respect** - Responsible for studentsâ€™ academic achievement and professional behaviours. Ensuring that all students, regardless of background, were able to access the curriculum and achieve their best. This required working together and developing relationships with the students and their families in order to support them best.
- **Coaching, Wellbeing and Equal Opportunities** - Leading the coaching team and supporting the special educational needs and disabilities department to ensure equal access for all students. Providing support to colleagues to help them tailor their lessons and interactions with students with varying additional needs, including a large number of neurodiverse students.
- **Flexibility and Willingness to Learn** - Comfortable with learning new skills on the job and turning my hand to other things; although I trained as a French and Spanish teacher, I have also taught Maths, Digital Media, English and Science over the years. Much like coding, although the general teaching skills are the same across subjects, each subject has its own syntax and idiosyncrasies that need to be learnt. I am comfortable doing this.

<br>**Tradewind Recruitment** (_October 2013 - November 2015_):  
_Supply Teacher_

- **Adaptability** - As a supply teacher working across a range of schools, you are asked to go into a school, understand its policies and get on with the job at hand, often teaching a subject about which you have little knowledge. The two years I spent doing this developed my ability to adapt to new situations and contexts quickly.

<br>**Raynes Park High School, Raynes Park** (_July 2006 - August 2013_):  
_Head of House & Head of Spanish  (Final Positions)_

- **High Aspirations** - I believe that all people can achieve their best when correctly supported to do so. Responsible for academic progress and professional behaviours in my house, I held students accountable for their work and behaviour, while supporting them to move forward to the next stage and improve.
- **Leadership and High Aspirations** - Leading a team of tutors to support developing aspirations in students and support them with their journey applying to university. Leading the establishment of the Spanish department and liaising with other departments and the school timetabler to ensure success.
- **Innovation** - Teaching and developing a set of resources for the new Spanish department and updated resources for the Work Skills department; collaborating with colleagues to implement these materials. Also teaching French & General Studies.


## Skills

- **Positive** - I am very much a "glass half full" type of person and I use this positivity to bring people with me in projects. This skill has been developed working with teenagers who often initially didn't want to learn what I needed to teach them. Through working with them and supporting them, I was able to bring them with me to achieve the desired end result.
- **Passion for learning** - Learning new things has always inspired me. Assimilating a vast amount of knowledge each week on the Makers Bootcamp has reinvigorated my desire to learn more. In my teaching career, I have learned new subjects and kept abreast of teaching methodologies and techniques while going above this and developing my skills as a middle leader through the Middle Leadership Development Program. Supported by monthly seminars, I implement a new student support system, increasing achievement for the targeted students. As Lead Personal Coach I trained as a Personal Performance Coach with The Coaching Academy. Learning new skills helps me develop my job and recognise improvements I could make.
- **Empathetic** -  I am an empathetic person and fit well into a team aided by my training as a personal performance coach. The many teams I have worked in over the years have required different approaches to ensure a good working relationship with every team member. I am energised by working with other people and actively enjoy team work and pair programming. 
- **Explanations** - Training as a teacher has provided me with the tools to explain technical concepts in a straightforward, intelligible manner to non-technical people, which will help when needing to communicate with other teams across the business. I am also keen, further down the line, to use these skills to help develop more junior colleagues.
- **Agile Methodologies** - Learning the basics of Agile methodologies at Makers has shown me that my natural manner for leading and contributing to projects is Agile in nature. My line management style supports my team members to implement their own projects iteratively over time and celebrates smaller steps made each week.
- **Leadership** - Experience of planning and implementing projects means I am able to look at a task, not solely from my own perspective, but also take into account the wider business implications and bring multiple stakeholders on board with the project.

## Hobbies
I like a lot of variety in my life, so while I love coding and using tech, I'm also keen to get out and do more active things. I love to travel, developing my language skills where possible. I am a keen ballroom and latin dancer which keeps me fit and I love going to the theatre. At home I get a lot of enjoyment from basic carpentry, making things for the home and garden.
