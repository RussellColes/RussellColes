# Hi, I'm Russell! :wave:

I'm an enthusiastic junior developer currently actively looking for work. Having completed a Bootcamp in Software Engineering at Makers, I'm really exciting about pushing my skills further when I join my first dev team. I'm currently working hard to increase my knowledge of the softwares I've used so far and extend my learning into aspects of cloud and data engineering. My previous career as a leader in education has given me strong commmunication and people skills, alongside the ability to organise myself and others well. I love a good challenge, and having taught people how to learn for many years, I am well able to learn new skills quickly myself.

## Skills

- **Positive** - I am very much a "glass half full" type of person and I use this positivity to bring people with me in projects. This skill has been developed working with teenagers who often initially didn't want to learn what I needed to teach them. Through working with them and supporting them, I was able to bring them with me to achieve the desired end result.
- **Passion for learning** - Learning new things has always inspired me. Assimilating a vast amount of knowledge each week on the Makers Bootcamp has reinvigorated my desire to learn more. In my teaching career, I have learned new subjects and kept abreast of teaching methodologies and techniques while going above this and developing my skills as a middle leader through the Middle Leadership Development Program. Supported by monthly seminars, I implement a new student support system, increasing achievement for the targeted students. As Lead Personal Coach I trained as a Personal Performance Coach with The Coaching Academy. Learning new skills helps me develop my job and recognise improvements I could make.
- **Empathetic** -  I am an empathetic person and fit well into a team aided by my training as a personal performance coach. The many teams I have worked in over the years have required different approaches to ensure a good working relationship with every team member. I am energised by working with other people and actively enjoy team work and pair programming. 
- **Explanations** - Training as a teacher has provided me with the tools to explain technical concepts in a straightforward, intelligible manner to non-technical people, which will help when needing to communicate with other teams across the business. I am also keen, further down the line, to use these skills to help develop more junior colleagues.
- **Agile Methodologies** - Learning the basics of Agile methodologies at Makers has shown me that my natural manner for leading and contributing to projects is Agile in nature. My line management style supports my team members to implement their own projects iteratively over time and celebrates smaller steps made each week.
- **Leadership** - Experience of planning and implementing projects means I am able to look at a task, not solely from my own perspective, but also take into account the wider business implications and bring multiple stakeholders on board with the project.
